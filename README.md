# Personal Portfolio Website

## About
---
The code for my website, which can be found [here](https://jdalamo.com).

## Stack
---
- Node.js
- Express
- MySQL

## Backend
---
I used Node.js for my backend as it's both an industry standard and a great way to learn JavaScript (one of my goals for this project).  On top of Node.js I used Express as my web framework.

## HTML
---
I used Handlebars for my HTML templating because I wanted the features of a templating engine while being able to write native HTML.  All the page HTML files are located in the /views/pages/ directory and they extend the base layout (layout.hbs), which can be found in the /views/layouts/ directory.

## CSS
---
All CSS can be found in the /static/css/ directory.  CSS Grid is used extensively in this project to create page layouts.
